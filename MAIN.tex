    % Abstract
    \section*{Abstract}
    The rise of wearable health devices has increased data collection. Our society is moving toward a Dataistic model, where data is becoming increasingly dominant. This development raises significant concerns, especially for users. As data becomes the new gold, users find themselves disempowered in the current centralized model. This thesis investigated how wearable users evaluate decentralized data technologies as potential solutions, focusing on the complex mix between privacy concerns, control preferences, and adoption willingness.
    We collected data from 240 respondents across four languages through an online survey, analyzing results through clustering, regression, and factor analysis, while benchmarking against external data. The findings revealed two distinct user profiles: \textit{Pragmatic Sharers} and \textit{Skeptics}. The gap between perceived control (65\% reporting little to none) and desired control (85\% wanting high or complete) highlights clear failures in the centralized model.
    Control preference, rather than privacy concern, emerged as the key factor driving willingness to adopt decentralized solutions. This reframes the traditional privacy calculus. In centralized systems, privacy concerns may block adoption, but the promise of control can transform those concerns toward interest in alternatives. However, significant barriers persist: nearly half of respondents remain unfamiliar with decentralized technologies, and security concerns, time burden, and complexity further complicate adoption.
    This research offers a dual-process model explaining how defensive and aspirational behaviors are shaped by distinct psychological mechanisms. The findings highlight the need for developers to prioritize tangible control mechanisms, as meaningful protection is only possible with active user involvement.
