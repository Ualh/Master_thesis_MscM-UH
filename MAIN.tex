    % Abstract
    \section*{Abstract}
    The rise of wearable health devices has increased data collection. At the same time we live in a society that converge towards a Dataistic model that gives more and more power to data. This is concerning. As data becomes the new gold, users find themselves disempowered in the current centralized model. This thesis investigated how wearable users evaluate decentralized data technologies as potential solutions, focusing on the complex mix between privacy concerns, control preferences, and adoption willingness. 
    We collected data from 240 respondents across four languages through an online survey, analyzing results through clustering, regression, and factor analysis, while benchmarking against external data. The findings revealed two distinct user profiles: "Pragmatic Sharers" and "Skeptics." An interesting gap emerged between perceived control (65\% reporting little to none) and desired control (85\% wanting high or complete) which suggests a clear signal of centralized model failure. 
    The most powerful insight was Control preference, not privacy concern, that drives willingness to adopt decentralized solutions. This reframes the traditional privacy calculus. While privacy concerns act as dealbreakers within centralized systems, the promise of tangible control can channel those same concerns toward constructive interest in alternatives. However, significant barriers persist: nearly half of respondents remain unfamiliar with decentralized technologies, and security concerns, time burden, and complexity further complicate adoption.
    This research contributes a dual-process model of user decision-making where different psychological mechanisms govern defensive versus aspirational behaviors. The findings suggest developers should prioritize visible, tangible control mechanisms over abstract privacy promises as you can't meaningfully protect what you don't actively control.
